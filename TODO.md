## Blockers

### SUID Sandbox

```
[31341:31341:0611/040512.056408:FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(158)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /nix/store/98a01h4pabdqsbf6ghny3chzgpp3z5h4-chromium-83.0.4103.97-sandbox/bin/__chromium-suid-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
```

The Ubuntu kernel is hardening and requires AppArmor profile to be created for applications that use the SUID sandbox. This includes:
- Brave
- Chrome
- Chromium
- Discord
- Microsoft Edge
- Vivaldi

...and many more application based on Chromium such and anything Electron.

Using `sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1` may have been disabled in
recent Ubuntu releases, so AppArmor profiles appear to be the only option.
Ubuntu ships nearly 150 AppArmor profile in `/etc/apparmor.d` and they can often
be used repurposed to create one for applications in the Nix store.

The post explaining [a permissive AppArmor profile](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/89599#issuecomment-2922388555)
was the clue to getting this working.

The major browser has AppArmor profile for Nix currently configured via system-manager.
**It works, but something more flexible/maintainable will be required.**
