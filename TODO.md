# Challenges

## SUID sandbox and bwrap

```
[31341:31341:0611/040512.056408:FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(158)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /nix/store/98a01h4pabdqsbf6ghny3chzgpp3z5h4-chromium-83.0.4103.97-sandbox/bin/__chromium-suid-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
```

- üêõ **[Google Chrome complains that its SUID sandbox isn't configured correctly](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/89599)**

The Ubuntu kernel is hardened and requires AppArmor profiles for applications that use the SUID sandbox.
This includes:
- Brave
- Chrome
- Chromium
- Discord
- Microsoft Edge
- Vivaldi

...and many more applications based on Chromium, such as Electron apps.

Using `sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1` may have been disabled in
recent Ubuntu releases, so AppArmor profiles appear to be the only option.
Ubuntu ships nearly 150 AppArmor profiles in `/etc/apparmor.d` and they can often
be repurposed to create profiles for the Nix store.

The post explaining [a permissive AppArmor profile](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/89599#issuecomment-2922388555) was the clue to getting this working.

The other option, that worked, was to use an [Ubuntu mainline kernel](https://kernel.ubuntu.com/mainline/)
due to their relaxed kernel hardening. The other drawback of using a mainline
kernel is hardware support regressions, such a panel backlight not working
correctly on my AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 5650U powered ThinkPad X13.
